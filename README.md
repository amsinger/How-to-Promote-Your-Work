How to promote your work

* If you're job hunting (and even if you're not), use github as a portfolio site where potential employers can get background information about your project. It's good practice to create a README file for each of your repositories. You can tell the backstory of your project. Include details that will let an editor understand how you approached the project and any challenges it raised. 

* Information to add includes: 

      -- what it is
      -- why you did it 
      -- how you did it
      -- where the data came from
      -- how long it took
      -- how you would make it better 
      
* Always add a link to the actual page, so the editor can see the project :)

* Explaining your original intent and where you got the data are most important. 

* You can customize your pins and choose what to show on top. See the [github profile guide](https://help.github.com/en/categories/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile).

* More [details](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-readmes) about READMEs from github.
