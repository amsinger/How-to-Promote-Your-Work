# Promote Your Work With README.md Files

## Why Use a README.md?

If you're job hunting (and even if you're not), you can use github as a portfolio site to show potential employers background information about your projects. It's good practice to create a README file for each of your repositories. They will be easy for potential employers to find and will allow you to include details about the project that won't fit on a resume or in a cover letter. You can tell the backstory of your project and track the methods you used to find the data and the challenges you faced in wrangling it. There's no single format. Focus on details that will let an editor understand how you approached the project and how you handled any challenges. 

## What a README.md Should Include

Information to add includes: 
  - a brief description of the project 
  - why you did it 
  - how you did it
  - how the project evolved from the initial pitch
  - where the data came from
  - obstacles that arose and how you dealt with them
  - how long it took
  - how you would make it better 

      
Most important to include: An explanation of your original intent and where you got the data. 

Always add a link to the actual page, so the prospective employer can see the project :grinning:
