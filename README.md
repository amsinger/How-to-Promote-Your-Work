How to promote your work

* If you're job hunting (and even if you're not), use github as a portfolio site where potential employers can get background information about your project. It's good practice to create a README file for each of your repositories. You can use it to tell the backstory of your project -- what it is, why you did it, how you did it, where the data came from, how you would make it better -- details that will let an editor understand how you approached the project and any challenges it raised. 

* Very important, add a link to the actual page, so the editor can see the project :) 

* Here are some samples for guidance:
